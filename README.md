# Classification-of-Beans
Focuses on exploring data for classifying seven registered varieties of dry beans using computer vision techniques.

Data Contains 13,611 high-resolution images of dry bean grains with 16 extracted features (12 dimensions and 4 shape descriptors).

Current Progress:
1. Duplicate Handling: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
2. Encoding: Transformed categorical data into numerical formats for easier analysis.
3. Visualization: Created visual representations to explore and understand feature relationships.
4. Model Development: Implemented and evaluated various classification algorithms.

This repository now includes cleaned data, model implementations, and testing datasets.
