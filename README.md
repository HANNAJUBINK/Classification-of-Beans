# Classification-of-Beans
Focuses on exploring data for classifying seven registered varieties of dry beans using computer vision techniques.

Data: Contains 13,611 high-resolution images of dry bean grains with 16 extracted features (12 dimensions and 4 shape descriptors).
Current Progress:
1. Duplicate Handling: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
2. Encoding: Transformed categorical data into numerical formats for easier analysis.
3. Visualization: Created visual representations to explore and understand the relationships between features.
   
This repository includes the cleaned data and visualization code, laying the foundation for future classification model development.
